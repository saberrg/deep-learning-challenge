# Using Deep Learning to Find Sucess within Organizations

## Overview

Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, is in need of developing a tool to identify applicants most likely to succeed in their endeavors when funded. Using machine learning and neural networks with the sklearn and Tensorflow libraries. This model will predict whether applicants have a high likelihood of success if they receive funding from Alphabet Soup using the given dataset (charity_data.csv) to train the model.

The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning and neural networks to help make decisions on the best business venture. 


The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results: Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions:

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
